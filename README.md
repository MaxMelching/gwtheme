# GWtheme

This repository contains LaTeX and Google Slides templates based on the
[`gwbar`](https://github.com/MaxMelching/gwbar/) package.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask me and/or open up a
GitHub issue.

***Disclaimer***: I do not own the rights to certain corporate design elements
(especially logos) used in the examples and do not claim to do so (I just
happened to be part of the corresponding institutions when writing this code).
Use them at your own risk and only if you have permission!

## Usage (LaTeX)

In order to use compile main etc, you have to download the `gwbar` package from
GitHub and place the corresponding `.sty` files (plus any `.txt` files that you
intend to use) into the `GWtheme/` folder. (Note: You can also put it in some other
folder, but in that case you have to adjust the usage of the package in
`GWtheme/beameroutertheme`, particularly the involved paths.)
An alternative to placing these files in the each project folder (which means
you have to make any changes, such as customization or regular updates, to all
files separately) is to install `gwbar` after the download; to see how this can
be done, check out [my GitHub](https://github.com/MaxMelching/latex_package_install/)
on this).

Once `gwbar` is all set up, you are ready to use `GWtheme` just like any other
beamer theme. If you are not too familiar with this, it might be worthwhile to
check out the [examples folder](examples/).

***Note:*** A strange observation (maybe not so strange, but rather very
LaTeX-like) is that if some warnings or errors are emitted during compilation,
compiling again often resolves all issues.

## Usage (Google Slides)

Please refer to the  `work_flow` Markdown file in this repository.
