# GWtheme

This repository contains LaTeX and Google Slides templates based on the
`gwbar` package.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask me :)

## Usage (LaTeX)

In order to use compile main etc, you have to download the `gwbar` package from
GitHub (avaliable at https://github.com/MaxMelching/gwbar) and put the
corresponding `.sty`, `.txt` files into the `GWtheme/` folder (you can also
put it in some other folder, but in that case you have to adjust the usage
of the package in `GWtheme/beameroutertheme`, particularly the involved paths).

A strange observation (maybe not so strange, but rather very LaTeX-like) is that
if some warnings or errors are emitted during compilation, compiling again often
resolves all issues.

## Usage (Google Slides)

Please refer to the  `work_flow` Markdown file in this repository.
